Content: ttree of Lambda candidates produced from generic MC15 rd. ~1M: signal (isSignal==1), ~1M: Ks background (isSignal==0). (Here, 1M is allocated to the corresponding selected events according to the total number of MC15rd events of each type {uu/dd/ss/ccbar, mixed, charged})
Purpose: used in analysis/examples/tutorials/B2A916-TrainLambdaSelector.py to train KsVeto
